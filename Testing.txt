Go to the repository on github. (Say it’s by myfriend, and is called the_repo, then you’ll find it at http://github.com/myfriend/the_repo.)
Click the “Fork” button at the top right.
You’ll now have your own copy of that repository in your github account.
Open a terminal/shell. Type: $ git clone git@github.com:username/the_repo
Change into that project directory
Add a connection to the original owner’s repository (for me this step worked automatically): $ git remote add myfriend git://github.com/myfriend/the_repo
make changes
git add and git commit those changes
git push them back to github. These will go to your version of the repository.

Need to be updated.
